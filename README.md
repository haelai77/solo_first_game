# leo-s_first_game
This is a repo for the first solo game I'm ever going to make.

<img src="/SKETCHES/SKETCH_FILE.png" alt="Alt text" title="Optional title">

Ideas: in unity
* multiplayer wizard game?
* line art with sobel filtering or cell shading copying https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlKNOirh66E&t=2s
* initial basic spells will be taught, later on new attributes will be discovered, no tutorial of new spells so players have to memorise them
* alchemy on the side? like farming for magical plants?
